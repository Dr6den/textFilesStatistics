The narrator, Sal Paradise, starts to tell the story: he, with his "intellectual" friends,
was a young writer in New York City in the winter of 1947, depressed and bored, when Dean Moriarty
arrived in New York City. Dean has just gotten out of reform school, just married a pretty young blonde,
Marylou, and they have come to New York City for the first time, from Denver. Sal heard of Dean before 
from Chad King and was intrigued--Dean used to write Chad from jail, asking questions about Nietzsche.
Sal and his friends go to see Dean and Marylou in a dumpy flat in Spanish Harlem. Dean comes to the door
in his shorts; he is occupied with Marylou, and he has to make explanations to her. Dean is frenetic, hyper,
and full of ideas. He speaks formally, in long, rambling sentences. Sal's first impression of Dean is that he
is like a young Gene Autry, a real representative of the West. They drink and talk until dawn.
